# BadgerBots AbstractSim 2023 Code Release
This repository contains the code used to train the policies used in Robocup 2023 by team BadgerBots.

It contains code for training both the attacker and goalie policies, and each folder has its own readme for how to use the training and evaluation code. 

It should be fully possible to train and export a working goalie policy using the instructions in the AbstractSimGoalie readme; The AbstractSimAttacker code release still needs a bit more polish to not require manual steps for setup and local training, but should be ready soon.
